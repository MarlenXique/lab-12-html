Originally I wanted to put my recently created youtube channel but theres two problems, I dont have the time right now to make content and I was planning to make content after this term is done. And 2: I want to be a faceless content creator. I didn't know we had to present to the whole class. But that's ok. Right now i have a website from another class that's based on my favorite singer and i think that as more time advances, Itâ€™ll look better and i could link it on my homepage. And thats about all the content for now. I'll still be creating more.
