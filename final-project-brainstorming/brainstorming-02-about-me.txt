I graduated from fort Hamilton High school in the year 2020. I have always lived in Brooklyn, New York and I don't travel a lot. But that's because of choice. I love where I am currently living and I can't imagine leaving. I am currently an undergraduate in City Tech and start in fall of 2020. I was actually put into an emerging media technology major by accident and when I realized it wasn't what I intended to study, it was too late to change it. Turns out though, I really enjoy coding. Right now i am learning: Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Arduino. It gets difficult at times because of the differences between them but i make it work. Learning what’s inside of technology is great but my goal is to learn C++. Which I eventually will academically. I want to learn this language to learn what's inside of games.
I have two big goals. Which i am ok with equally. I either become someone who makes games, or plays them. Streaming and playing games is something I've been dreaming about since 2016 but I have never had the materials for it. I did however study streamers’ mannerism and what makes them successful. Recently I've saved up for a Gaming PC, so hopefully everything turns out great. Again though, if anything I would enjoy making games. Right now my inspiration is the creators of among us. Three people made this game that peaked over the last couple of months. And only three people made it happen.
